Object-Oriented Design:
The system follows strong OOP principles:

Encapsulation

Each class encapsulates its data with appropriate attributes and methods
Access to data is controlled through well-defined interfaces


Inheritance

DataStore serves as a base class for specialized data storage classes


Polymorphism

Multiple implementations of similar operations (e.g., different ways to search and filter across classes)
Method overriding in derived classes



Key Classes:

Model Classes

User: Stores user credentials and roles
Product: Manages product information and stock
CartItem: Handles individual items in a cart
Cart: Manages the collection of items and calculates totals
Transaction: Records completed sales for history


Data Storage Classes

DataStore: Base class with common storage operations
UserStore: Manages user data persistence
ProductStore: Handles product data
TransactionStore: Stores transaction history


UI Classes

LoginScreen: User authentication
SalesScreen: Main POS interface
ProductManagementScreen: Product CRUD operations
TransactionHistoryScreen: View past transactions
UserManagementScreen: User management
MainWindow: Overall application control



Running the Application:
To run this POS system, you'll need:

Python installed (3.6+)
PyQt5 installed (pip install PyQt5)
Save the code to a file named main.py
Run it with python main.py

The system starts with a login screen (default admin credentials: username "admin", password "admin"). Different features are available based on user roles to ensure proper system security.
